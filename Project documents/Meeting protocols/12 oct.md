## Objectives (5 min)

   * The group managed to create a fully functional game loop!
   * The scoreboard and game rules have not yet been looked into.
   * Henrik and Ellen have implemented (a lot) of GUI tests!
   * Robert has improved undo/clear functionality in PaintingView, used findBugs and PMD to improve code, attempt to use STAN.
   * Markus and Aron has been hard at work fixing pesky bugs.


## Discussion items (35 min)
   * Decide on game rules - game rules will be included as a separate document.
   * Add new view where player gets to choose one of three word, each with a different level of difficulty.




Rules
There are three difficulties on the words. And they give 3-2-1 points.
The Painter is given 60 seconds to paint, and the guesser is given 30 seconds. 
Failure to guess the correct word will result in a lost streak and end of the game session.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
   * Henrik will ask Alex about components and general expectations about SSD/RAD.
   * The group will implement game rules.
   * The group will implement a scoreboard.
