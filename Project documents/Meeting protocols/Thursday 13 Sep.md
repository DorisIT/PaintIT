# Meeting Agenda

Group: 11 (PaintIT)
Date: 2018-09-13
Chair:  Aron Sj√∂berg
Secretary: Markus Pettersson
Participants: Ellen, Henrik, Robert, Markus, Aron


## Objectives (5 min) 

- Resolve any issues preventing the team to continue.
- Short clear descriptions.

What is a system design document? Where do we find the template for it?

Not everyone has been able to complete the Junit/Travis workshop yet.


## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Each group member reports outcome of assigned issues, see also 'outcomes and
  assignments'.

Each group member did their respective assigned issues, which was to compose at least 2 user stories each. Currently the group as a wholes has composed 17 in total, which should be sufficient to get started with the project.

## Discussion items (35 min)

- Discuss the identified issues, and possibly new or more general issues (very
  short notes and/or keywords).

Discussed new rules regarding supervised meetings, we think they are better than the previous ones.

The group should look into designing the first draft of the UML in order to be able to start coding on the project. 

The group has not yet assigned technical roles/responsibilities, which should strongly be considered so that everyone knows where to start.


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

- Outcomes from discussion items. Write down what's decided and why it was 
  decided. Sync with other documentation (add terms to wordbook).
- (re)Assign to each group member which issues to solve.

Technical roles within the team was decided for the first sprint. Robert and Markus will be responsible for the first iteration of the Canvas, Aron for words/letters generation and Ellen and Henrik will take on the main menu. This is not set in stone, and each member can and probably will be working in different areas of responsibility during the first sprint.

The application will from now on contain language support for english only. Language support for swedish has therefore been dropped.

Start working on first iteration of a UML for the application.

Robert will take notes during the next supervised meeting with Ayberk.

## Wrap up

- Write down any unresolved issues for next meeting. 
- Decide a time and location for next meeting.

The next meeting will be held tuesday 18/9 at 9 a.m - 13 a.m
