Group: 11 (PaintIT)
Date: 2018-09-18
Chair:  Markus Pettersson
Secretary: Ellen Widerstrand 
Participants: Ellen, Robert, Markus, Aron, Henrik


## Objectives (5 min) 

- Resolve any issues preventing the team to continue.
- Short clear descriptions.


* We are not sure how to design our UML (how the controller/(s) will communicate with the views), we will ask Ayberk about this. 
* We haven’t transferred our tasks from product backlog to sprint backlog. 
* Ayberk didn’t send the link to the git-tutorial he recommended. :(


## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Each group member reports outcome of assigned issues, see also 'outcomes and
 assignments'.


* Aron has started working with showing the words in the view.
* Ellen and Henrik have done the FXML-files for the main menus.
* Robert and Markus have worked with the model. They have a canvas and a tool. It is possible to draw.


## Discussion items (35 min)

- Discuss the identified issues, and possibly new or more general issues (very
 short notes and/or keywords).
* Discussed possible way to solve controller/view-problem.
* We need to look at our Domain Model and think about the feedback we got (word/tiles, teams as well as high score). We still want 8 tiles. 
* We want both team and player. Player has a name, that is basically it. The team keeps track of who is drawing and who is guessing. 
* We will from now on use Javadoc using this styleguide. http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7-javadoc


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

- Outcomes from discussion items. Write down what's decided and why it was 
 decided. Sync with other documentation (add terms to wordbook).
- (re)Assign to each group member which issues to solve.


* Aron uploads this week’s meeting protocols to github.
* We are going to transfer our tasks from product backlog to sprint backlog. 
* Everyone needs to read the guide for Javadoc.
* Aron works with the wordview.
* Markus and Robert are working with paintingview.
* Ellen and Henrik are adding backend for the main menu and adding more views.

## Wrap up

- Write down any unresolved issues for next meeting. 
- Decide a time and location for next meeting.


   * The next meeting will be held friday 21/9 9:00.
