Story Name: How to play

## Description 

As a beginner, I need to get instructions/rules so I can play the game properly.

## Confirmation

- Are the instructions easy to find at all stages in the game?
- Can a new player read the rules/instructions and understand how to play?
- Can I reach “How to play” when I’m playing a game?
- Can I go back from “How to play” without restart the application?
