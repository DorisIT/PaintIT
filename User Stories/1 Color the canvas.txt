## Description 

As a <Artist>, I need to be able to add color to a canvas so that i  can create art digitally.

## Confirmation

- If I drag the mouse on the canvas, will there be color?
- if I drag the mouse outside the canvas does it not draw?
- Am I only able to draw on the canvas during the drawing-phase of the game?
