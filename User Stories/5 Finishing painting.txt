Story Name: Finish a painting




## Description 


As a drawer in the game, I need to be able to finish a painting so that the guesser can make his guess.


## Confirmation

- Can I my mark my painting as done?
- Will it be the other players turn if I mark my painting as done?
- Is the painting shown to guesser
- Is the painting unmutable after I mark it done?
