## Description 


As a player of this game, I need to get a countdown before the guessing-phase so that the guesser has time to prepare.


## Confirmation

- Can I see how long time it is left before my turn starts?
- Do I have enough time to turn the computer around for the guesser?
- Is it clear when my turn starts?
