Story Identifier: STK016
Story Name: Hints


## Description 

As a player, I need to be able to get a hint that makes it easier to guess the word drawn so that I dont get stuck.


## Confirmation

- Can I reveal one or more letters in the correct word?
- Can I limit the letters I have to guess from?
- Is there a consequence/cost for the player getting a hint?
